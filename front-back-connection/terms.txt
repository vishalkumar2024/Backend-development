-> What Is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism built into web browsers
   that controls how resources (like APIs) are shared between different origins 
   (domains, ports, or protocols).


-> CORS allows your frontend (React, for example) running on one origin 
   (like http://localhost:3000) to communicate safely with a backend (Node.js/Express
    API) running on another origin (like http://localhost:5000).

 . Without proper CORS setup, your browser blocks the request for security reasons.


-> When developing full-stack apps (like React frontend + Express backend), our 
   frontend and backend often run on different URLs depending on the environment:

  Environment	            Frontend URL	           Backend URL
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 🧑‍💻 Development	        http://localhost:3000	   http://localhost:5000
 🚀 Production             https://yourfrontend.com    https://api.yourbackend.com

 we should not hardcode these origins into our backend.
 Instead, use environment variables to load them dynamically.
